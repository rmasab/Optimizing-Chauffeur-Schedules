### Optimizing a Transportation Company’s Chauffeur Schedules ###

 * **Objective:** Maximized opportunities and revenue through optimization of chauffeur schedules
 * **Reason:** Schedule optimization makes a difference in overall efficiency as a transportation company
 * **Recommendations:**
    * Sunday and Monday are ideal days off for chauffeurs
    * Implement morning shifts at 5:00 am - 16:00 pm and evening shifts at 17:00 pm - 4:00 am 
    * Introduce idea of shift rotations so that morning and evening chauffeurs can reap benefits equally
 * **Next Steps:**
    * Compare NYC Taxi data against rideshare companies like Uber or Lyft
    * Analyze taxi data in other states such as California
    * Analyze FHV data from 2020 from TLC since it is more inline with this company’s operations of pre-arranged trips
